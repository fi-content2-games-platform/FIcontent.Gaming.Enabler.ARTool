Developer Guide for the ARTool SE
====================================
The ARTool SE enables rapid creation of AR applications without any coding required using web platform and intuitive UX. The tool has two main components:

Software as a Service (SaaS) – Genie Creator This module enables a the cross-platform development of smartphone and PC AR applications using a drag and drop with no programming knowledge required.

Platform as a Service (PaaS) – Genie Deploy This is a cloud based backend module enabling building, implementation and storage of developed AR applications. It enables deployment of the complex AR engine in tasks such as image recognition, 3D model mapping as well as in defining the AR content initiated by a marker (based on location, compass, face, QR code or an image).

The creator is located at http://srv.dunavnet.eu/ARTool/

It currently enables creating 4 different types of applications:
  - Taking photo
  - Greeting Card
  - Treasure Hunt
  - ARvatar game

The step-by-step guide on how to create photo and ARvatar games is briefly given below. The greeting cards and Treasure Hunt applications follow the same principles.

Taking Photo
------------
- Photo Step 1

  Go to “New presentation” folder. You are at step “1 Template” and choose template “PHOTO”. Go to step “Basic Info”.

- Photo Step 2

  You are at step “2 Basic Info”. Enter into dialogue box “Presentation name” – this will be the name of your AR presentation visible on ARTool market if you choose to go “public” with your presentation. Select from drop down menu Presentation category: “Business” or “Fun” or “Other”– this categorization will serve for easier search and classification on the presentation market.”Save” and go to step “3 More info”.

- Photo Step 3

  You are at step “3 More info”. Enter “Presentation description” – a short description which will help end user to understand what your presentation is about. It will appear below the Presentation name (“Presentation name”) on the presentation market. Enter “Keywords” separated by commas (for further categorization and easier search of your presentation). Select “Presentation icon” from offered list (this will define visual appearance of presentation icon) of existing images or “Browse” for image you want to use as app icon. If you decide to share the developed AR presentation you can enter email addresses of people with whom you want to share it with (select “+” to add more user’s email addresses). “Save” and go to “4 Presentation”.

- Photo Step 4

  You are at step “4 Presentation” – Slide “First Slide”, Marker selection. To create AR presentation on top of static content you need AR marker and AR image (model). By clicking on the right hand side of the First Slide bar the “Slide setup” window is opened, where you can specify the name of the First slide, and select the image to be AR marker which will trigger display of the AR content. The “Image marker quality” is a measure how detectable is the marker. Aim for good to excellent image quality. “Save” image marker when finished.

- Photo Step 5

  You are at step “4 Presentation” – Slide “First Slide”, AR model (content) selection. Use drag&drop to position “2D Model”, “3D Model” or “Photo” to position an image to be shown as AR content. You can select the image and choose at which orientation it will be displayed (parallel, orthogonal with respect to the marker or gui ). Note: If you choose Gui option we recommend image resolution 720×1280 pixels, png format, with transparent background - example.

  When finished “Save” the presentation and go to “My Presentations.”

- Photo step 6

  You are at step “4 Presentation” – Slide “Static Content”. You can modify Static Content which is always present when taking ARgenie photo. It consists of: Flash button, Shot button and Frame. By double clicking on their graphical representation in the main window the dialogue box opens which allows you the following: (i) Flash button – “Customize” option allows you to enter text and define its font, color and size as well as chose the background color; “Upload image” option allows you to use any image you prefer; “Choose icon” option allows you to use predefined icon for flash button. (ii) Shot button – defines a look of the button that will be used to take AR photo, the options being the same as for Flash button; You can choose to add „Share button“ with „Shot button“ which allow you to share your photo with friends via email, Facebook etc. (iii) Frame – “Choose” option allows you to chose from the existing selection of frames; “Upload” allows you to select image you prefer to be your frame - Recommended resolution is 720×1280 pixels picture, png format, with transparent background - example.

- Photo step 7

  Your presentation is visible in „My Presentations” folder and you can choose to keep it private or make it public. You can also “delete” it or modify it using “edit”. To download your presentation go to the presentations overview inside mobile ARTool app; Enjoy it!

  You are at step “4 Presentation” – Choose the location for the game from the drop down menu.

- ARvatar step 6

  Define the upper, middle and lower threshold for the temperature and upper and lower thresholds for the CO2. This threshold will define how the 3D model is changed according to the readings from the ekoNET device.

  When finished “Save” the presentation and go to “My Presentations.”

- ARvatar step 7

  Your presentation is visible in „My Presentations” folder and you can choose to keep it private or make it public. You can also “delete” it or modify it using “edit”. To download your presentation go to the presentations overview inside mobile ARTool app; Enjoy it!
